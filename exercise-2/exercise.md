### **Brief**

1 - Answer these questions about the design of this [landing](https://logtail.com/)

a) What makes this a good design? What elements? What decisions?

There are multiple elements that are making a good design on the logtail.com website.
When you enter the website you can immediately see it's purpose.The big title "Query your logs like you query your database" 
tells you what is the point of the site.In addition, there is a nice animation that engage the user to really look at the text and to connect it with
the animation on the right part of the screen.Another good thing about the design is the consistency in colors.The designer carefully selected the color scheme for the site
so that it match the website industry.Since the website is used in tech industry the main color on the site
is dark blue,which is used a lot in the tech(code editors,different testing environments etc.)
Same thing for color scheme applies on typography.It is consistent and carefully selected by the designer.
Another thing I like is good content hierarchy, meaning that most important parts are on
the top and as you scrolling you are seeing less and less important parts for Logtail brand.As a user I really do like the animations on the site.
They are consistent and definitely improving the overall UX.Another thing that makes this site a good design
is navigation.It is simple and easy to use.On top of that navigation is sticky, meaning that you can always use it while scrolling on the site.Finally, the mobile / tablet design of the website
is great. Design is adjusted to type of screens and browsers.

b) How do you think was the process of the designers to get to this result?

I think that designer first wanted to know the Logtail industry/brand in order to choose correct
colors and typography.After that designer must know what is the website about, and what are the most important information that website will bring in order
to achieve content hierarchy. Then designer should spend some time researching the market,similar websites etc.After that designer can start with low-level mock-ups for different components.After components
are finished designer will probably start connecting them to actual mock-up screens.When mock up screens are finished, designer can start
with real UI development that includes the previous selected color scheme and typography.

2 - Using Figma, create a mood board about the landing. Represent these three aspects:

a) Color palette

b) Illustrations style (related in some way to the landing)

c) Typography (find one similar in Google fonts if the original is not free)

### **Important clarifications**

- These 2 points should take you less than an hour.
- The mood board should not be a big design project, it is just to demonstrate you have a well understanding of Figma as a tool. Think of it as a sketching task that should be done in around half an hour, it's shouldn't be pixel perfect.
